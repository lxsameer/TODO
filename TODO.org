** Notes
*** Checkout Pedestal's stream response.
    http://pedestal.io/reference/streaming

*** We need to think of a way to share state between components.
    Some state like `KTable`

*** How can we rewind the offset of Kafka Component ???
*** Changes to Workflow
**** Map
**** Filter
**** Reduce
**** Agg
**** Join
*** Investigate the possiblities of having a global stat in the system
** Ideas
*** Attach processing time to the value moving in the pipeline.
    So we can measure how much time it takes for each componenet to process the value
** TODOs
*** TODO Check for `start-fn` return value spec.
*** TODO Handle the missing component name in `:workflow`
*** TODO Create components from a function
    Basically a dummy stop function, and a start fn to wrap the function.

** Stream functions
*** filter
*** map
